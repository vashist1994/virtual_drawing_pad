# virtual_drawing_pad

# Description
 This project is about tracking the path of the object. 
 Here I am using opencv and tracking the blue colored object using color as the prime key component. 
 I kept storing the points of the blue color object and connect those point. 
 In the end we get a virtual drawing pad we can use it as an interface to various machine learning and deep learning problems 
 instead of using the traditional UI based approach.
 
 ## Technology used
 - Opencv
